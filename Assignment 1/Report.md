In this directory I have uploaded an .ipynb file which contains a plot of all the equations 𝜭(log n), 𝜭(n), 𝜭(n**2), 𝜭(n**3) and 𝜭(n**k) where n=7 and k=4.
From the plots drawn, we can see that the graph of 𝜭(log n) has the lowest gradient or steepness, and 𝜭(n**k) has the highest gradient or steepness.
Thus we can conclude that 𝜭(log n) is the best case among all the other equations has it has the lowest gradient meaning it takes the lowest time from the rest.
