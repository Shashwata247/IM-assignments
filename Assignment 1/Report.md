In this directory I have uploaded an .ipynb file which contains a plot of all the equations 𝜭(log n), 𝜭(n), 𝜭(n^2), 𝜭(n^3) and 𝜭(n^k) where n=7 and k=4.
From the plots drawn, we can see that the graph of 𝜭(log n) has the lowest gradient or steepness, and 𝜭(n^k) has the highest gradient or steepness.
The graph of 𝜭(n) has a slightly higher gradient than 𝜭(log n), 𝜭(n^2) than 𝜭(n) and 𝜭(n^3) than 𝜭(n^2).
Thus we can conclude that 𝜭(log n) is the best case among all the other equations as it has the lowest gradient meaning it takes the lowest amount of time from the rest
