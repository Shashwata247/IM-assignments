In this directory I have uploaded an .ipynb file which contains a plot of all the equations 𝜭(log n), 𝜭(n), 𝜭(n^2), 𝜭(n^3) and 𝜭(n^k) where n=7 and k=4.
From the plots drawn, we can see that the graph of 𝜭(log n) has the lowest rate of increase of gradient or steepness, and 𝜭(n^k) has the highest rate of increase of  gradient or steepness.
The graph of 𝜭(n) has a slightly higher rate of increase of gradient than 𝜭(log n), 𝜭(n^2) than 𝜭(n) and 𝜭(n^3) than 𝜭(n^2).
Thus we can conclude that 𝜭(log n) is the best case among all the other equations as it has the lowest rate of increase of gradient meaning it takes the lowest amount of time compared to the rest.
